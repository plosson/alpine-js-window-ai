# AlpineJS x window.ai

This is a simple single page HTML that demonstrates how to integrate [window.ai](windowai.io) to build a chatbot 
interface. The app provides a user-friendly chat interface for users to communicate with an AI assistant.

It uses [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 

## Features

- User-friendly chat interface
- AI assistant powered by [window.ai](windowai.io)

## Requirements 

You need to install the [window.ai](windowai.io) Chrome extension as explained here. 

## Installation

Just server the index.html page using this for example : 

```shell
npx serve -p 9999
```

Then navigate to 

http://localhost:9999


## Usage

1. Type a message in the input field at the bottom of the chat window.
2. Hit "Enter" to send the message.
3. The AI assistant will respond with a message after processing your input.
4. Continue the conversation by sending more messages.
